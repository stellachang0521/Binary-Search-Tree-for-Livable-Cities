# Binary-Search-Trees-for-Livable-Cities

This is a tool that utilizes binary search trees to aid users in finding their most livable cities in the US.
Users will be able to search through data trees according to their selected criteria to get recommendations for the cities that suit their living needs the most. 
As a user initiates a search, data will be organized and filtered through different trees structured from the userâ€™s selected criteria.
Selection criteria include cost of living, property index, July mean temperature, and December mean temperature. Users are prompted to search in their preferred value range of a certain criteria.
After providing search standards for the binary search trees, users will also be presented different data visualization options to choose from.

Data are stored into binary search trees using classes. The criteria values are used as keys while the city names act as the payloads of the nodes. 

The data used in this tool were mostly cached from the Numbeo and Statistical Weather Data APIs. Authorized API keys are provided in the code, but you can apply for your own.
